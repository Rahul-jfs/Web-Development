    <h3>The display: inline-block Value</h3>
    <p>
      Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display:
      inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are
      respected, but with display: inline they are not. <br />Compared to
      display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does
      not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to
      other elements.
