    <h1>CSS grid layout</h1>
    <p>
      A grid is a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines defining
      rows and columns. Elements can be placed onto the grid within these column
      and row lines. CSS grid layout has the following features:
    </p>
    <h2>Grid container</h2>
    <p>
      We create a grid container by declaring display: grid or display:
      inline-grid on an element. As soon as we do this, all direct children of
      that element become grid items.
    </p>
    <h2>Grid tracks</h2>
    <p>
      We define rows and columns on our grid with the grid-template-rows and
      grid-template-columns properties. These define grid tracks. A grid track
      is the space between any two adjacent lines on the grid. The image below
      shows a highlighted track â€“ this is the first-row track in our grid.
      <br />
      .wrapper { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px; }
      <br />
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
      <br />
      the above can be written as <br />
      grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
      <br />
      grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
      <br />
    </p>
    <h2>Grid lines</h2>
    <p>
      It should be noted that when we define a grid we define the grid tracks,
      not the lines. Grid then gives us numbered lines to use when positioning
      items. In our three column, two row grid we have four column lines.
      <br />
      In the following example I am placing the first two items on our three
      column track grid, using the grid-column-start, grid-column-end,
      grid-row-start and grid-row-end properties. Working from left to right,
      the first item is placed against column line 1, and spans to column line
      4, which in our case is the far-right line on the grid. It begins at row
      line 1 and ends at row line 3, therefore spanning two row tracks.
      <br />
      The second item starts on grid column line 1, and spans one track. This is
      the default so I do not need to specify the end line. It also spans two
      row tracks from row line 3 to row line 5. The other items will place
      themselves into empty spaces on the grid.
      <br />
      .box1 { grid-column-start: 1; grid-column-end: 4; grid-row-start: 1;
      grid-row-end: 3; }
      <br />
      .box2 { grid-column-start: 1; grid-row-start: 3; grid-row-end: 5; }
    </p>
